# Custom Event Listener

![marketplace](/assets/MarketPlaceIcon.png)

Listen for custom events on your page
## Features

- The widget will listen for custom events on the document element
- When this event is detected, it can execute an action (Nanoflow, microflow, etc...)
- If you provide an attribute, it will put the value coming from `CustomEvent.detail` in this attribute before executing the action

## Example

### Configuration

![](/assets/configuration.png)
![](/assets/configuration_single_event.png)

- I have configured the widget to listen for a CustomEvent with the name `CustomEvent`
- When this event is detected, I execute the Nanoflow `OnAction`

Somewhere else in my page I execute a Nanoflow with a Javascript action. This action contains the following code:

```js
// This file was generated by Mendix Studio Pro.
//
// WARNING: Only the following code will be retained when actions are regenerated:
// - the import list
// - the code between BEGIN USER CODE and END USER CODE
// - the code between BEGIN EXTRA CODE and END EXTRA CODE
// Other code you write will be lost the next time you deploy the project.
import { Big } from "big.js";

// BEGIN EXTRA CODE
// END EXTRA CODE

/**
 * @param {string} eventName
 * @param {string} eventData
 * @returns {Promise.<boolean>}
 */
export async function FireAction(eventName, eventData) {
	// BEGIN USER CODE
	const eventOptions = eventData ? { detail: eventData } : {};
	return document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(eventName, eventOptions))
	// END USER CODE
}
```

In this case, I execute this Javascript action with `eventName = 'CustomEvent'` and no data.
